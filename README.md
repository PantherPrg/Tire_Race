# PPSC Comp March 2021: Tire_Race
**| difficulty: 1/10 |**

You live in a little town called Oldham, on the side of a mountain, with great food, sights, but not much technology or sports. But, there is an annual tradition in Oldham which basically the entire population attends. The Oldham tire race. Teams find their own tires to roll down the mountain of Oldham, and the first one to cross the finish line wins their own donkey! You know your tire's **radius**(in meters) and can predict **average rotational speed**(radians/second) for the race. Find out your tire's actual (tangential) speed.

Example: 
radius = 5 (meters)
average rotational speed = 10 (radians/second)

equation: Velocity(tangential) = radius * average rotational speed
v_t = 5 * 10
v_t = 50

return "50\n"
